Prestige System Integration Guide
============================

To integrate the prestige system into your game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the following files in your game directory:
   - prestige.js
   - prestige.css
   - prestige-section.html

2. Add these lines to the <head> section of index.html (after artifacts.css):
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="prestige.css">
   <script src="prestige.js" defer></script>

3. Add the prestige menu item to the sidebar in index.html:
   Find the section with class="menu-item" data-section="shop" and add the prestige menu item right after it:
   <div class="menu-item" data-section="prestige">
       <i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i>
       <span>Prestige</span>
   </div>

4. Add the prestige section HTML:
   Find the last game section in index.html and add the contents of the <section> element from prestige-section.html after it.

5. Add the prestige modal:
   Add the prestige modal HTML (the last <div> in prestige-section.html) near the end of the body, where other modals are located.

6. Initialize the prestige system:
   Find the initApplication() function in index.html and add this line after initializePrestigeSystem():
   initializePrestigeSystem();

The prestige system includes:
- A new menu item in the sidebar
- A prestige section with current points and upgrades
- A confirmation modal for prestige resets
- Four permanent upgrades that persist through resets
- Automatic saving/loading of prestige data

All the necessary JavaScript functionality is in prestige.js, and the styles are in prestige.css.
The system will automatically calculate prestige points based on the player's progress and handle all the upgrade mechanics.
